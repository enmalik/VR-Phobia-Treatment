BEFORE RUNNING A SESSION, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO DO A TEST/DUMMY SESSION AFTER GOING THROUGH THE FOLLOWING STEPS:

1) Make sure that "Psychologist Interface" and "RT Biometrics" are in the same directory

2) RT Biometrics/processing.py

Ensure that the COM port is correct.

3) Make sure FRAPS is running in the background.

On General tab, check "Start FRAPS minimized", "Run Fraps when Windows starts", "Minimize to system tray only".

On FPS tab, disable "Benchmarking Hotkey" and "Overlay Hotkey". Check "Hide Overlay".

On Movies Tab, CHANGE THE FOLDER TO THE EXTERNAL HDD. ex. "F:\Videos". Sometimes the drive letter will be different on different computers. Make sure the "Video Capture Hotkey" is set to F9. Check "Half-size". Set a custom frame rate, something like "5" or "10". Do not choose 60, 50 or even 30 fps. DO NOT CHECK "split movie every 4 Gigabytes".  Check "Record Win7 sound, stereo", "Record external input". Everything else on the right hand side remains unchecked.

Ignore the "Screenshots" tab.

3) Psychologist Interface/pimain.py

MAKE SURE THE FOLLOWING THREE VARIABLES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILE ARE CORRECT:

vlcMacDir = '"C:/Program Files (x86)/VideoLAN/VLC/vlc.exe"'
udkDir = '"C:/UDK/Skyscrapper/Binaries/Win32/UDK.exe"'
frapsVidsDir = "F:/Videos/"

Chances are, they will be different for each computer. So update them accordingly.

AGAIN, AFTER THESE CHANGES, RUN A TEST SESSION TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS WORKING PROPERLY.
